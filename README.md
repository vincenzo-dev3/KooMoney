## 🐣 What is Koo?

**Koo Money** is a social payment protocol designed to solve Hedera's "First Mile" problem: **User Onboarding.**

Currently, gifting or sending crypto to a new user requires the recipient to have a wallet, a seed phrase, and an exchange account setup beforehand. This friction kills adoption.

**Koo reverses the flow:**
1.  **Asset First:** Wrap HBAR, USDC, or HTS Tokens into a "Magic Link" (Smart Escrow).
2.  **Wallet Second:** Send the link via WhatsApp, Twitter, or Email. The recipient claims it using **Google Login**, creating a non-custodial Hedera wallet instantly.

> *"We are building the infrastructure to make crypto transactions as seamless as sending a text message."*

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎁 Viral Gifting (Link-to-Asset)
Create a unique URL that holds value. Send it anywhere—DM, Email, or SMS. If the link isn't claimed within a set period, the funds are automatically refunded to the sender, ensuring zero risk.

### 🦢 Phygital Cards (Real World Assets)
Bridge the gap between digital code and real-world connection. Users can generate premium "Origami" paper wallets or order physical cards to gift HBAR offline at conferences, events, and holidays.

### ⚡️ The Koo SDK (Infrastructure)
We are building the rails for the broader ecosystem. The Koo SDK allows **Games, DAOs, and Wallets** on Hedera to integrate "Payout Links" directly into their own applications, driving network transaction volume and simplifying user payouts.

### 🛡 Trustless Architecture
Built on the **Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS)**. Koo never holds user funds. Assets are locked in audited smart contracts and released only upon cryptographic signature from the authorized claimant.
